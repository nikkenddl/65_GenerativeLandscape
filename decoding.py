"""
Reconstruct Cells and Trees from a JSON archive.

Assumptions:
- The JSON file contains two keys: "cells" and "trees".
- The Cell record stores "forest_region_id" but not the full forest_region;
  a dummy or lookup value will be used for reconstruction.
- The Tree record stores a "placed_cell_id" field that references a Cell.
- The point objects are represented as dictionaries with "X", "Y", and "Z".
- Reconstruction bypasses the __init__ methods, so any runtime registration
  (like appending a cell to a forest_regionâ€™s list) must be done separately.
